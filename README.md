# CERN_RD53B_EMULATOR

Emulator model for the RD53B ASIC in the Atlas detector of the LHC at CERN

The plan is to implement the emulator in on various Xilinx FPGA on different boards.

KC705 - Kintex
VC709 - Virtex
'SLAC board' -also a Kintex

The emulator will generate compressed/encoded data streams and also respond to register write/read commands.
